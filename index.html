    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>My name is <strong>Agassi Victoria Eribo</strong>. I'm born in January 2004. 
        We are eight in my family, I have 5 siblings and I am an only daughter.
        By birth I am a Benin Republican but by origin I am a Nigerian from Delta State.
        I graduated from a Nigerian Highschool in July 2023 the second time after iniatially graduating from a Beninese school in 2021. 
        I appreciate the richness and diversity that life offers, encompassing a tapestry of experiences and moments that grant meaning and purpose. 
        The opportunity to embrace each day with gratitude, to forge meaningful connections with others, 
        and to partake in the beauty of the world around us are aspects I deeply cherish. 
        Furthermore, the continual journey of learning and personal growth, as well as the chance to contribute 
        positively to the lives of those around me, are sources of profound contentment.
